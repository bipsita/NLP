# Question/Need

In this study, I will look at Uber reviews over different parts of the world for the years 2013 to 2019. I will model the topics given the number of stars over different time spans to see how the reviews changed as people grew more familiar with Uber. 
# Data Description
The data is a Kaggle dataset of 2348 reviews. The unit of analysis is one review. Some of the reviews mention the location of the ride. 

The features will be the topics in the review.

# Tools
Either NLTK or SpaCy for text analysis and tools for visualization. 

# MVP
A topic model of the data showing the various topics over time for the different stars.
